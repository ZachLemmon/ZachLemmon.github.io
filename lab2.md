### Debugger

Android Studio provides a debugger that allows you to do the following and more:

- Select a device to debug your app on.
- Set breakpoints in your Java, Kotlin, and C/C++ code.
- Examine variables and evaluate expressions at runtime.

### Built-In Emulator

The Android Emulator simulates Android devices on your computer so that you can test your application on a variety of devices and Android 
API levels without needing to have each physical device.

The emulator provides almost all of the capabilities of a real Android device. You can simulate incoming phone calls and text messages, specify 
the location of the device, simulate different network speeds, simulate rotation and other hardware sensors, access the Google Play Store, and 
much more.

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Android Studio is it's own IDE

### Advantages

- Supports Gradle
- Debug mode is excellent
- It is open source
- It is free
- Provides Java to Kotlin code auto translation
- Intuitive

### Disadvantages

- Slow startup for emulator
- Needs high end processor and lots of RAM to run smoothly
- Multitasking is very difficult in Android Studio due to its heavy consumption of resources
- Heavy application

### Language Availability

There are too many to list fully but some of them are:

- English
- French
- Spanish
- Dutch
- German

### Uploading and Selling an app

Google Play charges a one time fee of $25 to make your account a developer account.
Free apps are distributed at no cost, and paid apps have 30% of revenues taken for "carriers and billing settlement fees".

### Market Share

Android Studio has a market share of 1.95%.
