## Welcome to My Website

Hello, my name is Zach Lemmon. I am 20 years old and I am a third-year student in the Durham College Computer Programmer Analyst(CPA) program.

This website is for my MODE-4201 course.

### MODE-4201

There is a big demand for mobile development due to the large and medium sized companies are increasingly adapting
to the mobile world in this rapidly and technologically changing society. This course investigates the different Mobile
Architectures (Native, Web App and Cross-Platform) on various Platforms with examples.

The course introduces to students the concepts, tools and techniques used to develop quality Mobile Apps for
diverse Platforms and Devices, including Apple iOS, Android, and Windows with examples covering all the different
Architectures. The students will create Mobile Apps covering Native and Hybrid Architectures using easily available
Tools.
